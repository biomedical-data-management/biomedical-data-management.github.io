## Background
Understanding the human body and providing effective personalized healthcare is increasingly dependent
on our ability to process vast heterogeneous datasets. However, practitioners are often overwhelmed due to
a lack of tools and expertise in the field of data management.

This interdisciplinary workshop will focus on data management techniques, tools, and systems with direct
applications to the unique challenges in biomedical research and healthcare. Our overarching goal is to develop
a community around these topics and foster lasting collaborations between data management researchers
on one side and biomedical informatics practitioners on the other, covering the full range of research
activities from single molecules to patients and populations. We want to provide a platform for promoting
the advancement of data management research into these fields, making a positive impact on the pace
of scientific progress in foundational research as well as in translational medicine, and ultimately
empowering clinicians to provide better care to their patients.
