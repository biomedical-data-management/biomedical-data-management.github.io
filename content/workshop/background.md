## Background

<!-- Understanding the human body and providing effective personalized healthcare is increasingly dependent
on our ability to process vast heterogeneous datasets. However, practitioners are often overwhelmed due to a lack
of tools and expertise in the field of data management. -->

This interdisciplinary workshop will focus on data management techniques, tools, and systems with direct
applications to the unique challenges in biomedical research and healthcare. Our goal is to
develop a community around these topics and foster lasting and fruitful collaborations.

> Biomedical research and healthcare are increasingly data-driven,
yet practitioners regularly struggle with data management challenges.

We are witnessing a proliferation of data collection technologies (e.g., electronic health records,
high-throughput sequencing, medical imaging), the growing adoption of computational methods for data analysis,
and the recognition that data is crucial for unlocking new scientific insights and improving patient
care. Furthermore, the scale of data that is being collected is growing exponentially,
driven by the decreasing costs of data acquisition technologies and the increasing digitization of healthcare systems.
However, the people who produce, analyze, and interpret biomedical data (e.g., clinicians, digital health
specialists, bioinformaticians etc.) often lack the expertise and tools to effectively manage and analyze
these multi-modal datasets at scale. This means that scientific progress is often limited by overwhelming
data management challenges.

> Data management researchers are well-equipped to tackle many of these challenges, and are actively
seeking new research directions.

Data management researchers have spent decades developing techniques, tools, and systems for managing
large-scale data. They possess valuable expertise in areas such as data integration, data quality,
data governance, and scalable analytics. However, as evidenced by some points raised at panels at
SIGMOD and VLDB 2025, there is a growing push for data management researchers to actively pursue new,
high-impact application domains whose requirements can inspire fundamentally new system designs, benchmarks, and
end-to-end deployments. Biomedical data management is one such domain,
presenting unique research opportunities that can directly impact and improve human lives.

> Bringing these two communities together can unlock the potential for novel solutions and
accelerate scientific progress.

One noteworthy challenge is that data management researchers often lack exposure to real-world biomedical
datasets (due to privacy restrictions), as well as the domain knowledge necessary to understand the specific
challenges and requirements of biomedical data management. Conversely, biomedical researchers often lack
awareness of the latest advances in data management research and how these techniques can be applied to their
specific problems. As a result, there is a gap between the capabilities of existing data management
systems and the needs of biomedical researchers and clinicians. Our goal is to bridge this gap
by bringing together experts from both communities to identify pressing biomedical data management challenges
and explore opportunities for collaboration that can lead to the development of novel data management
solutions tailored to the biomedical domain.
