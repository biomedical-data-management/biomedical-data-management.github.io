As an inaugural workshop, our goal is to hear as many voices as possible, providing the attendees with a thorough overview of
the current state of the field.
To complement our selection of esteemed speakers, we encourage the community to submit proposals for talks
that will (1) highlight key problems and/or potential solutions, and, optionally, (2) outline visions of
collaborative projects. Hence, we will accept two types of submissions:

* **Lightning Talk Proposal (1-2 pages, ~5-10 minutes):**
This will serve as an initiation talk for community members.
From biomedical researchers, we expect problem statements that
describe a current approach to their data management challenges. From data management researchers,
we expect an exposition of their domain of expertise and a vision (not necessarily realized) of how it can
be applied to specific problems in biomedical data management.

* **Project Talk Proposal (up to 4 pages, ~15-20 minutes):**
This talk should either outline an existing successful project or present a viable project vision.
An ideal project should (a) involve folks from *both communities*,
and (b) *meaningfully advance* both biomedical research and data management research. As such, upon completion, a
successfully executed project should ideally be able to result in publications at both
a top-tier data management conference (e.g., [VLDB](https://vldb.org/), [SIGMOD](https://sigmod.org/)),
and a top-tier biomedical journal (e.g., [Nature](http://nature.com/), [Cell](https://www.cell.com/)).

### Timeline

* **June 1st, 2026 (11:59 PM AoE):** Submission deadline for all talk proposals.
Acceptance notifications will arrive by **July 1st, 2026**.

* **July 15th, 2026 (11:59 PM AoE):** Submission deadline for camera-ready papers and associated blog posts.

* **August 15th, 2026 (11:59 PM AoE):** Deadline for [talk merger](#talk-mergers) requests.

* **August 31st or September 4th, 2026 (TBD):** Day of the [workshop](#program).

### Collaborative Intiatives

One of our key goals is to organize a friendly scientific forum that encourages cross-disciplinary collaborations.
Apart from the in-person interactions that will take place during the workshop day, we are planning several
initiatives aimed at sparking productive joint efforts.

#### Discord Server

We started a [Discord server](https://discord.gg/mR7Fmh9JtG) that will serve as the main forum
for online interactions. We encourage interested participants to hop onto the server:

* Go to the `#introductions` channel and write a few sentences about their background and their motivation to join
the community. It is helpful to include links to online profiles (e.g., personal homepage, Google scholar)
both in the introduction and on your profile "About me".
* Ask a question to the chairs or offer some feedback on the `#questions-and-feedback`.
* Pitch their talk ideas on the `#talk-ideas` channel and ask for feedback.
* Propose a collaborative project on the `#project-ideas` channel and invite other members to join.

#### Talk Mergers

Community members that have had their lightning talk proposals accepted will be given a chance to
join forces with authors of other accepted lightning talks and request a *merger* into a single project talk.
After the camera-ready deadline, we will release all submitted proposals, associated blog posts, and author
information on the workshop website. The authors will be able to review each other's submissions and identify
complementary groups who they can get in touch with and come up with an idea for a joint project.

**Submitting a merger request:** The two author groups who have agreed to merge their talks should
send an email to the workshop chairs with a formal request, a statement of motivation,
a title and abstract of the new talk, and a brief outline of the structure of the new talk.
The proposed structure can still be based on the individual lightning talks, but should connect them into a cohesive
synergistic project vision.
The chairs will review the request and respond with their final decision that will be based on the main criteria for
project talk proposals (i.e., relevance, collaborative potential and feasibility).

**Accepted merger requests:** Authors of accepted merger requests will be given a regular project talk slot.
They will also be invited to submit a blog post about their proposed project vision which will be published on
the workshop website.

#### Vision Paper

Assuming the workshop proves successful at achieving its [main goals](#specific-goals), the co-chairs will
start a working group for producing a vision paper to be submitted to
[PVLDB](https://www.vldb.org/pvldb/volumes/20/contributions) that will outline the conclusions of the
workshop and lay out a vision for a future comprehensive biomedical data management system.
**All speakers and authors of accepted submissions will be invited to join** this working group and contribute to this
paper as co-authors, leaving a lasting artifact that will hopefully inspire more future work in this space.

<!--
### Formatting guidelines

Submissions should adhere to the official
[PVLDB volume 19 formatting guidelines](https://www.vldb.org/pvldb/volumes/19/formatting).

#### Lightning Talk Proposal

TBD

#### Project Talk Proposal

TBD -->

### Review process

All submissions will receive double-blind peer-reviews from a program committee consisting of both biomedical
researchers and data management researchers. Each submission will be assigned to at least two reviewers with
relevant expertise. The review criteria will focus on the clarity of the problem statement, the relevance to biomedical
data management, the potential for cross-disciplinary collaboration, and the feasibility of the proposed project
(for Project Talk Proposals). We will also consider the novelty and potential impact of the proposed ideas.

<!-- ### Post-acceptance process
