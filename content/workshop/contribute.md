As an inaugural workshop, our goal is to hear as many voices as possible, providing the attendees with a thorough overview of
the current state of the field.
To complement our selection of esteemed speakers, we encourage the community to submit proposals for talks
that will (1) highlight key problems and/or potential solutions, and, optionally, (2) outline visions of
collaborative projects. Hence, we will accept two types of submissions:

* **Insight Talk Proposal (1-2 pages, ~5-10 minutes):**
This will serve as an initiation talk for community members, allowing them to share
their expertise and spark ideas for future projects.
This talk should ideally focus either on presenting problems (nails) or solutions (hammers)
related to biomedical data management.
From biomedical researchers, we expect talks about ***nails***, i.e., problem statements that describe a current data management or
processing workflow, and an overview of some painful challenges associated with that workflow.
From data management researchers, we expect ***hammers***, i.e., expositions of a data management system
or methodologies that they have expertise in and visions
(not necessarily realized) of how they can be applied to specific problems in biomedical data management.

* **Project Talk Proposal (up to 4 pages, ~15-20 minutes):**
This talk should either outline a work-in-progress project or present a viable project vision.
An ideal project should (a) involve folks from *both communities*, (b) identify an *important nail* matched with
the *appropriate hammer*, and (c) *meaningfully advance* both biomedical research and data management research.
As such, upon completion, a successfully executed project should ideally be able to result in publications at both
a top-tier data management conference (e.g., [VLDB](https://vldb.org/), [SIGMOD](https://sigmod.org/))
and a top-tier biomedical journal (e.g., [Nature](http://nature.com/), [Cell](https://www.cell.com/)).

### Important dates

* **May 15th, 2026 (11:59 PM AoE):** Submission deadline for [all talk proposals](#submission-guidelines).
Acceptance notifications will arrive by **June 15th, 2026**.

* **July 1st, 2026 (11:59 PM AoE):** Submission deadline for [camera-ready](#camera-ready) papers and associated blog posts.

* **August 15th, 2026 (11:59 PM AoE):** Deadline for [talk merger](#talk-mergers) requests.

* **August 31st or September 4th, 2026 (TBD):** Day of the [workshop](#program).

### Review process

All submissions will receive single-blind peer reviews from a program committee consisting of both biomedical
researchers and data management researchers. Each submission will be assigned to at least two reviewers with
relevant expertise. The review criteria will focus on the clarity of the problem statement, the relevance to biomedical
data management, the potential for cross-disciplinary collaboration, and the feasibility of the proposed project
(for Project Talk Proposals). We will also consider the novelty and potential impact of the proposed ideas.
The final meta-review and acceptance decision will be made by the workshop chairs.

Accepted submissions will be invited to submit a camera-ready version as well as an associated blog. The camera-ready
version will be included in the workshop proceedings and hosted on OpenReview.
The blog post will be hosted on this community website and will serve as an easy-to-digest artifact.

### Submission guidelines

Talk proposals should be submitted to OpenReview as a PDF formatted according to the official
[PVLDB volume 19 formatting guidelines](https://www.vldb.org/pvldb/volumes/19/formatting).
Submissions that breach the formatting guidelines will not be considered.
Below, we provide a few general guidelines, followed by some guidelines specific to different submission types:

* **Author introductions:** To properly highlight all community members,
submissions should contain a final "Authors" section with a list of authors, their affiliation,
a brief bio (2-3 sentences), and whether they are coming from the biomedical or the data management community.

* **Mind the (language) gap:** Communicating across different scientific domains is no easy task.
In order to maximize understanding between communities, we encourage
authors to minimize the usage of domain-specific jargon in all submitted materials, or to provide
gentle and clear introductions before usage.

#### Insight Talk Proposal

* **Length:** Up to 2 pages (excluding references).
* **Novelty:** This type of submission does not have to represent novel work,
but it has to draw a clear connection to the [topics of interest](#topics-of-interest) and be
aligned with the overall [workshop vision](#vision).

#### Project Talk Proposal

* **Length:** Up to 4 pages (excluding references).
* **Novelty:** This submission should present either novel work-in-progress projects or
visions of novel future projects. Existing projects can be presented as [insight talks](#insight-talk-proposal).

#### Camera Ready

After a submission is accepted, the authors will be given a chance to submit a camera-ready version that
integrates reviewer feedback, includes any final touches, and any supplementary details that the authors
want to include (up to 2 additional pages).

#### Blog Post

Invited speakers and authors of accepted submissions are invited to contribute a blog post to the workshop website
highlighting key points of their talk. This will allow workshop attendees and other interested parties to
easily get acquainted with the author's work, even if they miss their talk. Some specific guidelines:

* **Length:** Flexible, but suggested length is 1000-2000 words.
* **Novelty:** The text is free to be copied from the original submission or any other content that
the authors produced in the past. That said, a light reflow is always beneficial to make the post accessible
to a casual reader.
* **Formatting:** The blog post should be submitted as a single `.md` text file written using
[Markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/). Additional  JPEG, PNG, or GIF images can be submitted
alongside, as well as author info. Blog posts should be submitted as a pull request to the
[workshop website](https://github.com/biomedical-data-management/biomedical-data-management.github.io).

## Collaborating

One of our key goals is to organize a friendly scientific forum that encourages cross-disciplinary collaborations.
Apart from the in-person interactions that will take place during the workshop day, we are planning several
online initiatives aimed at sparking productive joint efforts.

### Discord Server

We started a [Discord server](https://discord.gg/mR7Fmh9JtG) that will serve as the main forum
for online interactions. We encourage interested participants to join the server and:

* Go to the `#introductions` channel and write a few sentences about their background and their motivation to join
the community. It is helpful to include links to online profiles (e.g., personal homepage, Google Scholar)
both in the introduction and on your profile "About me".
* Ask a question to the chairs or offer some feedback on the `#questions-and-feedback`.
* Pitch their talk ideas on the `#talk-ideas` channel and ask for feedback.
* Propose a collaborative project on the `#project-ideas` channel and invite other members to join.

### Talk Mergers

Community members who have had their insight talk proposals accepted will be given a chance to
join forces with authors of other accepted insight talks and request a *merger* into a single project talk.
After the camera-ready deadline, we will release all submitted proposals, associated blog posts, and author
information on the workshop website. The authors will be able to review each other's submissions and identify
complementary groups with whom they can get in touch and come up with an idea for a joint project.

**Submitting a merger request:** The two author groups who have agreed to merge their talks should
send an email to the workshop chairs with a formal request, a statement of motivation,
a title and abstract of the new talk, and a brief outline of the structure of the new talk.
The proposed structure can still be based on the individual insight talks, but should connect them into a cohesive
synergistic project vision.
The chairs will review the request and respond with their final decision that will be based on the main criteria for
project talk proposals (i.e., relevance, collaborative potential, and feasibility).

**Accepted merger requests:** Authors of accepted merger requests will be given a regular project talk slot.
They will also be invited to submit a blog post about their proposed project vision, which will be published on
the workshop website.

### Vision Paper

Assuming the workshop proves successful at achieving its [main goals](#specific-goals), the co-chairs will
start a working group for producing a vision paper to be submitted to
[PVLDB](https://www.vldb.org/pvldb/volumes/20/contributions) that will outline the conclusions of the
workshop and lay out a vision for a future comprehensive biomedical data management system.
**All speakers and authors of accepted submissions will be invited to join** this working group and contribute to this
paper as co-authors, leaving a lasting artifact that will hopefully inspire more future work in this space.
