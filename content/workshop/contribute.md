As an inaugural workshop, our goal is to hear as many voices as possible, providing the attendees with a thorough overview of
the current state of the field.
To complement our selection of esteemed speakers, we encourage the community to submit proposals for talks
that will (1) highlight key problems and/or potential solutions, and, optionally, (2) outline visions of
collaborative projects. Hence, we will accept two types of submissions:

* **Lightning Talk Proposal (1-2 pages, ~5-10 minutes):**
This will serve as an initiation talk for community members.
From biomedical researchers, we expect problem statements that
describe a current approach to their data management challenges. From data management researchers,
we expect an exposition of their domain of expertise and a vision (not necessarily realized) of how it can
be applied to specific problems in biomedical data management.

* **Project Talk Proposal (up to 4 pages, ~15-20 minutes):**
This talk should either outline an existing successful project or present a viable project vision.
An ideal project should (a) involve folks from *both communities*,
and (b) *meaningfully advance* both biomedical research and data management research. As such, upon completion, a
successfully executed project should ideally be able to result in publications at both
a top-tier data management conference (e.g., [VLDB](https://vldb.org/), [SIGMOD](https://sigmod.org/)),
and a top-tier biomedical journal (e.g., [Nature](http://nature.com/), [Cell](https://www.cell.com/)).

### Timeline

* **April 15th, 2026 (11:59 PM AoE):** Submission deadline for **lightning talk proposals**. \
Acceptance notifications will arrive by May 1st. We ***encourage early submissions*** and will
make every effort to review them within 2 weeks.
<!-- Authors of accepted submissions will immediately be featured on the workshop website,
providing visibility to the rest of the community. -->

* **June 1st, 2026 (11:59 PM AoE):** Submission deadline for **project talk proposals**. \
Acceptance notifications will arrive by July 1st.

* **August 1st, 2026 (11:59 PM AoE):** Camera-ready and associated blog post submission deadline.

### Initiating collaborations

TBD

### Formatting guidelines

Submissions should adhere to the official
[PVLDB volume 19 formatting guidelines](https://www.vldb.org/pvldb/volumes/19/formatting).

#### Lightning Talk Proposal

TBD

#### Project Talk Proposal

TBD

### Review process

All submissions will receive double-blind peer-reviews from a program committee consisting of both biomedical
researchers and data management researchers. Each submission will be assigned to at least two reviewers with
relevant expertise. The review criteria will focus on the clarity of the problem statement, the relevance to biomedical
data management, the potential for cross-disciplinary collaboration, and the feasibility of the proposed project
(for Project Talk Proposals). We will also consider the novelty and potential impact of the proposed ideas.

### Post-acceptance process

TBD
